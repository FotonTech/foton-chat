## :star: Features

- Seamlessly integrated into the React Native CLI! :sparkles:
- Consistent with the default React Native template

## :arrow_forward: Quick Start

```bash
react-native init MyApp --template typescript && node MyApp/setup.js
```

## :question: FAQ

### Why this template when React Native 0.57+ supports TypeScript out of the box?

First of all, I started this template before React Native 0.57 came out. After React Native 0.57 was announced, I planned to stop maintenance on this template. But after further evaluation, there's still some manual work to do (add type definitions for React & React Native, create a `.tsconfig` for type checking, etc.) to properly set up a React Native 0.57+ TypeScript project. And that's where this template comes in and does that work for you. :raised_hands:

### What additional dependencies are included in this template?

- [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)
- [Type definitions for React & React Native](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)

This template always uses the latest versions of the dependencies at the time when the `react-native init` command is being executed. This means you don't have to worry about old versions.

Lots of :heart: and credits to the owners and maintainers of those packages.

### Why the setup script?

It deletes obsolete files like the `.flowconfig` and the `setup.js` itself after the setup.

### How to do type checking?

`npm run tsc`

### Does debugging work?

Yes it does.
